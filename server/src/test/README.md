## Things that did NOT work

See e94e29a236eec9bdb67346235dc533bbb1f681d7

(which I intentionally created for this purpose & then `g revert @` as fast as I could).

Other than that, I really enjoying writing my first-ever real tests.

A big motivator is that the API documentation gets generated based on them, which is absolutely awesome, thanks to [express-oas-generator (github)](https://github.com/mpashkovskiy/express-oas-generator), which is a great package.

I see potential in it, and I've been contributing. That's also been a fun experience:D

Overall, this was great. QA/10 would recommend.
