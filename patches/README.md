# patches

* `express-oas-generator` - https://github.com/mpashkovskiy/express-oas-generator/issues/37#issuecomment-582141420
* `lowdb` and `@types/lowdb` - https://github.com/typicode/lowdb/issues/385
* `@types/express`  - [already fixed](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/commit/03fa4ecc7ecbe94e50b5e5fe03d7add64a198198), but the fixes (also previous ones back to the version we are using) break other behavior, so we're staying with a patch for now.
