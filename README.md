## Other accomplishments alongside this project

> Some interesting stuff I've gone through thanks to this project

### Contributing to [express-oas-generator](https://github.com/mpashkovskiy/express-oas-generator)

I found a tool that could generate API documentation automatically for my `express` server - it was `express-oas-generator`. I've started using it here - it worked! However, I've encountered various issues with it, and thus [I've contributed heavily to the project](https://github.com/mpashkovskiy/express-oas-generator/pulls?q=author%3Akiprasmel+) & improved it both for myself & others!

### Using github actions (CI) with `semantic-release` & `lerna` and finding the deeply hidden bug

This one's worth a read:D https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/217

### & other goodies

the list is not exhaustive. I appreciate open source & try to contribute if possible - I encourage you too!
